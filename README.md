# save - A simple CRUD based persistence abstraction for storing objects to any backend data store. eg. Memory, MongoDB, Redis, CouchDB, Postgres, Punch Card etc.

**save** comes with a fully featured in memory engine which is super handy for testing your models.
For real world use you'll need to get one of the database powered engines:
* [MongoDB](https://github.com/serby/save-mongodb)

If your data store of choice isn't listed here please create an engine and send me a pull request.
